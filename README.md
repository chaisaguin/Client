## üóÇÔ∏è HOW TO RECREATE THE DATABASE FROM THE SQL DUMP
Make sure you are done with this step: [Java Database: MySQL JBDC Driver](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/p[MySQL JDBC DRIVER]rogramming/java/JDBC_Basic.html?fbclid=IwAR0Tb0gT4JBpLRwxk8c-f4Wsq0uVUvcyzBW-Ms3ZOEuAw87zfWTgQLN8oQE#zz-3)

1. Ensure You Have Cloned the Repository: Confirm that you‚Äôve cloned the entire application repository from GitHub, including the **‚Äúdb_dump.sql‚Äù** file.

2. **Open your CMD:** Open your command line and locate your MySQL installation folder (usually in the MySQL bin directory). 
*An example of the file address or file path: ‚ÄúC:/ProgramFiles/MySql 8.0/mysql/bin‚Äù. This is assuming MySQL is installed in that directory.*

3. **Next step is to start the MySQL Database Server:** Type in **mysqld --console** in the same command line. Make sure to leave this CMD open until the end of your use of the application.

4. To connect to our database, make sure to open **ANOTHER NEW CMD** to run the client. 

5. **Logging In to MySQL Server:** Once you have open another CMD, type in this command: **mysql -u myuser -p**
The ‚ÄúEnter password‚Äù will show up in the next line. The password is: **remwell996**

6. **Restore the Database from the Dump File:** Assuming the ‚Äúmanagementsystem‚Äù database already exists, restore the data from the dump file: **mysql -u myuser -p managementsystem < "C:\\path\\to\\db_dump.sql"**


7. **Verify the Database:**
- Reconnect to MySQL:
mysql -u myuser -p managementsystem

- Check if the tables and data are intact:
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
mysql> SELECT * FROM table_name;

8. Right then, you can be able to use our *Management System* as an admin with the privileges in **viewing, adding, deleting, updating clients and services.**
