## üóÇÔ∏è HOW TO RECREATE THE DATABASE FROM THE SQL DUMP
1. If you have already cloned the whole files for our application from the git hub repository, make sure that you have included the sql dump file named as *‚Äòdb_dump.sql‚Äô* as this is crucial in obtaining the database.

2. **Open your CMD:** Open your command line and make sure to locate your MySQL file. The goal is to find the root folder of your MySQL server application and locate its bin. An example of the file address or file path: ‚ÄúC:/ProgramFiles/MySql 8.0/mysql/bin‚Äù. This is assuming MySQL is installed in that directory.

3. Next step is to start the MySQL Database Server: Type in **mysqld --console** in the same command line. Make sure to leave this CMD open until the end of your use of the application.

4. To connect to our database, make sure to open **ANOTHER NEW CMD** to run the client. *Recall that the MySQL is a client-server system. Once the server is started, one or more clients can be connected to the database server. A client could be run on the same machine (local client); or from another machine over the network (remote client).To login to the MySQL server, you need to provide a username and password.*

5. **Logging In to MySQL Server:** Once you have open another CMD, type in this command: **mysql -u myuser -p**
The ‚ÄúEnter password‚Äù will show up in the next line. The password is: **remwell996**

6. After entering the password, the next line should tell you are welcomed to the MySQL monitor.

7. You can try to type in MySQL commands such as show databases; to show the current database that we are using entitled as ‚Äòmanagementsystem‚Äô. 

Type in another MySQL command **use managementsystem;** , then another command **show table** to display if you want to see the available tables and datas within it. You can select or view the data with an sql command *SELECT * FROM (Table Name)*

8. Right then, you can be able to use our *Management System* as an admin with the privileges in **viewing, adding, deleting, updating clients and services.**
